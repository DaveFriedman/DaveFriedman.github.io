    <h1>Privacy Policy for Gmail Mark Archived as Read</h1>

    <p>This policy exist to fulfill Google's requirement for OAuth Client Verification, as described at https://developers.google.com/apps-script/guides/client-verification on 7/13/2022</p>
    <br>
    <p>This app is a personal project intended for personal use. It's strange that you're even aware that it exists. If you use it, it's at your own risk. Children may not use it for any reason. I'm only making it public so I don't have to re-authorize my script every 30 days.</p>
    <br>
    <p>I keep no user information except for information Google keeps by default. I will share no user information unless Google or a government requires it. I am also bound by Google's terms, which you can find here https://developers.google.com/apps-script/terms.</p>
    <br>
    <p>An unrelated note to developers:<br>
    If you found this link because you were struggling to fulfill the OAuth Client Verification, you are free to copy and modify this policy as you please, at your own risk. I also found this link helpful:
